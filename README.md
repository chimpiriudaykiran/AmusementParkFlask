## Features

- **Virtual Queue:** Visitors can reserve their place in line for attractions through the website, reducing the need to physically wait in queues.

- **Wait Time Prediction:** The website utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict wait times for rides based on various factors such as historical data, current park attendance, weather conditions, and special events.

- **Interactive Map:** An interactive map of the park is available on the website, allowing visitors to explore attractions, dining options, and facilities.

- **Real-time Updates:** Wait times and queue status are updated in real-time, providing visitors with accurate information throughout their park visit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask:** Flask is used for server-side scripting, handling requests, and integrating the machine learning models for wait time prediction.

- **HTML/CSS:** The frontend interface is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is utilized for interactive features such as the virtual queue interface and dynamic updates on the wait time predictions.

- **Machine Learning:** Various machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze historical data and predict wait times for attractions.
